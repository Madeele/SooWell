            <h3>Food all over the Yoga</h3>
            <p>Next thing is that, yoga is also about food and music. It's a healthy way of eating and cooking that relates to well-being movement. While taking care about small things like everyday meals or songs we are listening to, changes can be visible. It is believed that with every act we are creating energy, basically positive one or negative one.<br><br>
