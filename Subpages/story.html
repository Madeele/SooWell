            <p class="greytext">My name is Magdalena Polakowska, I'm a Multimedia Design student on Business Academy Aarhus.
                Before getting interested in Arts, I was practicing yoga for four years and participating in additional classes.<br><br>

                Yoga gave me a lot of positive energy and it has a lot of advantages, that's why I decided to create
                an online magazine about it.

            <h3>Food as important as excercises</h3>
            <p>by Magdalena Polakowska<br><br>
            <p>Food and responsible cooking can be as important as all excercises you're doing while practicing yoga. There is a lot of rules that you should take under condsideration when it comes to getting full experience connected with wellness.
            Many people are talking about The Elements Rules when it comes to cooking. Every one of us is one kind of Elements, fire, air, earth or water. If you are a Fire one, you shouldn't eat for example spicy food beacuse you're an energetic person and after eating spicy things you can get more angry than usual. If you are an earth person you shouldn't eat some spices as well beacuse you'll be too sleepy or lazy.<br><br> Food can really change the way in which we feel and answer everyday challenges, we should eat food that will balance our characters. </p>

            <h3>Music can help?</h3>
            <p>by Magdalena Polakowska<br><br>

                While taking care about small things like everyday meals or songs we are listening to, changes can be visible. It is believed that with every act we are creating energy, basically positive one or negative one.</p>
