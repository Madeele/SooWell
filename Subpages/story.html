            <p class="greytext">My name is Magdalena Polakowska, I'm a Multimedia Design student on Business Academy Aarhus.
Before getting interested in Arts, I was practicing yoga for four years and participating in additional classes.<br><br>

Yoga gave me a lot of positive energy and it has a lot of advantages, that's why I decided to create
an online magazine about it.

            <h3>Food as important as excercises</h3>
            <p>Food and responsible cooking can be as important as all excercises you're doing while practicing yoga. There is a lot of rules that you should take under condsideration when it comes to getting full experience connected with wellness.<br><br>

                Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum</p>

            <h3>Music can help?</h3>
            <p>Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum<br><br>

                When people finally have time to think about themselves only, they start to believe more in their skills, notice what things they wanted to create or have done. It often happens that some of them start to even cry or laugh from nothing, because their body is finally rescued from the whole stress that was gathered before for weeks or months.</p>
