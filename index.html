            <h3>Understand, accept</h3>
            <p>But it's not all only about exercises, yoga is also connected with your approach to life. It's important to be able to understand the needs of your body due to living in peace with your soul and emotions.<br><br>

                While practicing you mostly have to discover what feelings are coming to you, understand them as well and try to use in the very best way later. If it's happiness - share it, if it's sadness- let yourself feel it and accept it, if it's excitement- go and do something creative.</p>

            <h3>See the difference</h3>
            <p>Many people after yoga exercises feels not only physical relief, they even feel like their mind is lighter and they are freer to do all things they wanted for whole day. It's mostly because we are closed so much in the routine and stress in everyday life that we don't have any possibilities to appreciate little good things that are happening.<br><br>

                When people finally have time to think about themselves only, they start to believe more in their skills, notice what things they wanted to create or have done. It often happens that some of them start to even cry or laugh from nothing, because their body is finally rescued from the whole stress that was gathered before for weeks or months.</p>

            <h3>Eat and listen carefully</h3>
            <p>Next thing is that, yoga is also about food and music. It's a healthy way of eating and cooking that relates to well-being movement. While taking care about small things like everyday meals or songs we are listening to, changes can be visible. It is believed that with every act we are creating energy, basically positive one or negative one.<br><br>
                After sending this energy, it comes back to us from all around, so while feeding your mind with positive emotions, we are sending positive energy and it will come back to us later.<br><br>

                You can read more about food in yoga <a href="/Subpages/other/recipes.html" class="links">here</a>, and about music in yoga <a href="/Subpages/other/music.html">here</a>,</p>

            <h3>Give yourself a chance</h3>
            <p>By giving to ourselves only best things, filled with love and positive energy, we can be sure that it makes changes in us and others. The most important is, to be aware of all your needs and feelings to be able to deal with them and take actions not to cover yourself with stress and negativity. Yoga is the perfect way to start living with peace and love with yourself in everyday life.</p>
